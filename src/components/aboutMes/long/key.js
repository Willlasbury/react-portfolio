      I started coding while I was a student at East Tennessee State University
      in 2015. During my last few years of college, I began doing research under
      on the binary star system Epislon Aurigea. At the start of this process my
      professor recommended that I start to learn Python. With that direction I
      self taught and presented my data analyses at the Tennessee Learning
      Symposium. Later on, as part of my computational physics course, I was
      taught Fortran77 and IDL. Since then I have done smaller projects and
      occassional coding challenges to keep up a base line of skill over the
      years.

        After I finished college I worked as an ropes course manager leading
        team building groups, until I eventually found a job as a part time Lab
        Analyst with Eastman Chemical Company in Kingsport TN. I started in an
        apprentice position working in their gas chromatography area, and worked
        for about six months, until I gained full time employment. From there I
        continued in the apprentice position, and started to learn liquid
        chromatography, various inductively coupled plasma (ICP) techniques, and
        a few others.

        While I was still in my apprenticeship phase of working, which was hard
        set at three years, I finished my continued education hours two years in
        ahead of schedule. Thanks to this, I was able to fill an empty trainer
        postion on my crew. As part of my new role I trained analysts in our
        cleanroom and ICP areas of the lab. So for a year while working at
        Eastman I help the dual role of apprentice and trainer, which I find
        fairly ironic.

        At the same time, my wife, who was a nurse, and I had been building up a
        savings pool and had been planning to quit our jobs to travel the
        country in the van we had built. A few months before we planned to quit,
        the pandemic began in the US. Also ironically, we postponed our road
        trip plans and kept working longer than we planned, largely because my
        wife felt a sense of resposibility to keep working; however, Tennessee
        did not see any fallout for months. Due to this a variety of other
        factors, my wife and I felt it was okay to restart our road trip plan.

        We left Tennessee in June of 2020, and travelled to Pennsylvania first
        and then slowly worked our way west, taking a fairly northern route. We
        were able to focus entirely on rock climbing during this time, and
        explore amazing places like the Red River Gorge, New River Gorge,
        Spearfish Canyon, Wild Iris, Indian Creek, and others. After six months
        of this amazing life style, my wife picked up a job as a travel nurse in
        Salt Lake City. Originally I was planning to pick up a job working at a
        ski resort outside Salt Lake, however on our first day climbing in
        Little Cotton Wood Canyon just outside Salt Lake, I had an accident
        while climbing (I fell while bouldering and "decided" to kick a rock on
        my way down) and ended up unable to walk for a couple months.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this was an unfortunate incident, it did lead to a few humerous
        situations, including me chasing a chicken with one foot and numerous
        days of climbing with crutches at the climbing gym. Mainly it kept me
        from finding any work that requireed me to be on my feet; and since I
        was only a short term resident, I was unable to find employment in any
        timely manner. So, with nothing to do I decided it probably time to pick
        up my programming habits again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was quickly realize how rusty I was at anything past looping over an
        array, and reached out to good friend, who was much more experienced
        than me, to do some pair programming. With his help I built a basic API
        built with Python and FastAPI. While this project did not end up going
        far, it was my first introduction to working with RESTful routing and
        building applications. After working on this for about two months, and
        slowly realizing that building a web app with python was like hammering
        a nail with screwdriver, my wife finished her contract in Salt Lake
        City. So we left Salt Lake, and our consistent internet connection, and
        headed to California to climb in Bishop.

        I tried to keep up my motivation to code, but after about a month of no
        internet, I eventually dropped my project entirely. Instead I focused on
        all the amazing climbing around us. I spent a month bouldering in the
        Volcanic Tablelands, outside Bishop, and then another month in the
        Buttermilk Boulders at the base of Mount Tom futher outside town. This
        time was largely filled with making new friends, climbing, and generally
        just having fun and living. Eventually though it started to get hot in
        California and we started to head north, with the goal of reaching
        Seattle for another nursing contract.

        What was supposed to be an easy month of travel quickly turned into and
        adventure of vehicle troubles, unplanned expenditures, and the other
        things that make road trips fun and exciting. But after all the twists
        and turns, we were able to make it to the Pacific North West. We found a
        to stay in Seattle, near some of our friends, and enjoyed the lasts bit
        of summer that Seattle had to offer.

        Seattle: (<>

      <p>
        Our time in Seattle was originally set to only be for three months, but
        it soon became apparent that estimate was far too short sighted. Coming
        from east Tennessee, the difference in pay was stagering. As it turns
        out, during the pandemic, travel nurses were making what was effectively
        four times the income that I was used to seeing in the Appalachains.
        This, mixed with the close proximity of friends, the abundant food, and
        other novelties of the city, we kept extending our time there.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time I had sought employment at a few of the climbing gyms
        near by. Unfortunately I was equally as unable to find employment, so
        similar to last time in Salt Lake City, I found myself drawn back to the
        computer. This time around I focused on computer science topics and
        began following along with some of MIT's free online courses.
